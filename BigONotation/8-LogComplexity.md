# Log Complexity

## What's a log?

**A logarithm is the inverse of an exponent**

- log base 2 (8) = 3 and 2 ^ 3 = 8
- these are inverse statements

`log base value = exponent` is the inverse of `2 ^ exponent = value`

- in log complexity, **the base value of the logarithm does not matter.**
    - **the base number is often omitted, and logatrithms are just written as log**



## Logarithmic Time Complexity
- O(log n) is a good time complexity. Not as good as a O(1) but better than O(n)
- O(nlog n) is better than O(n^2) but not O(n)

## Who cares?
- Certain search algorithms have logarithmic time complexity
- efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms
- recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity not time
