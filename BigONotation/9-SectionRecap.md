# Recap
- To analyze the performace of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
- Big O gives a hi lvl understanding of time or space complexity of an algorithm
Big O notation only cares about general trends (linear, quadratic, constant)
- time or space complexity depends only on the algorithm not the hardware of computer running the algorithm
- Big O notation is everywhere!
