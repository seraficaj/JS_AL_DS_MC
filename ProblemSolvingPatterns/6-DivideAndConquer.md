# Divide and Conquer Pattern
    - This patten involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.

    - This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity

## Example - Binary Search Algorithm

Given a sorted array of integers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the value passed to the function is located. If the value is not found, return -1.

```
search([1,2,3,4,5,6],4) // 3
search([1,2,3,4,5,6], 11) // -1
