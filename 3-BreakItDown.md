# Break It Down

Take the actual steps of the problem and write them down
- this doesn't even have to be pseudo code at this stage
- explicitly write out the needed steps
    - catch any conceptual issues/misunderstandings before worrying about details

## Example
    - Count the number of instances of each character in a string
