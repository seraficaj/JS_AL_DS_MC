# Solve Or Simplify
- After the 3 steps, you can start solving the problem
- Sometimes you cannot solve the problem just yet, that's where simplifying comes from.
    - simplifying is solving a simpler problem
    - ignore the harder part and focus on everything else
## Simplify
- find core difficulty
- ignore that difficulty
- write a simplified solution
    - what could you do to solve this problem?
- incorporate that difficulty back in
    - what needs to be added back to the simplified solution to make it work?

## Counting Each Character Example  
- core difficulty: checking if character is a number/letter
- simplified solution:
    - ignore checking a character
    - check if character exists in a string:
        - if it does, then it should be included in the output
- incorporating that difficulty back in:
    - use regex or a built-in method to check
    - most of the problem's logic can be done without this difficulty
