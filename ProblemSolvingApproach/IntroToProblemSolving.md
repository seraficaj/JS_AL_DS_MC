## Objectives
- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- compare/contrast problem solving patterns including
    - frequency counters
    - two pointer problems
    - divide and conquer

## What is an algorithm?
- an algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

## Why do I need to know this?
- Almost everything that you do in programming involves an algorithm
- it's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer
- interviews consist of problem solving in this industry

## How do you improve at solving problems?
- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns

## Problem Solving Strategies
- Understand the Problem
- Explore concrete problems
- break it down
- solve/simplify
- look back and refactor
