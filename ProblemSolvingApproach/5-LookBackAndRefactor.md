# Look Back and Refactor

## Ask these questions after you solve a problem:
- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?
