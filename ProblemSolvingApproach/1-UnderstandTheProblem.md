# Understand The Problem
1. Restate the problem in your own words
2. what are the inputs that go into a problem
3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. can outputs be determined from the inputs?
    - do you have enough info to solve the problem?
    - this question may not be answered at first
5. how should i label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

## An Example
    - Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum?
1. Restate the problem in your own words
    - "implement addition"
2. what are the inputs that go into a problem
    - ints?
    - floats?
    - what about very big numbers?
3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    - ints ?
    - floats ?
    - string ?
4. can outputs be determined from the inputs?
    - do you have enough info to solve the problem?
    - this question may not be answered at first
5. how should i label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
